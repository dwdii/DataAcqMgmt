# Data Acquisition & Management

This repository contains code I developed as part of my work in the 
[CUNY Master of Science, Data Analytics](http://sps.cuny.edu/programs/ms_dataanalytics) 
program's Data Acquisition and Management course (IS607) under Professor Michael Schulte.

## Highlights

### Week 4

During [week 4](https://github.com/dwdii/DataAcqMgmt/tree/master/Week4), I analyzed [IMDB](http://imdb.com) 
movie data transformed and shared by [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/). 
Some of the charts resulting from my analysis follow.

### Week 7

During [week 7](https://github.com/dwdii/DataAcqMgmt/tree/master/Week7), I imported a limited set of 
[Wikipedia WikiStats](https://aws.amazon.com/datasets/4182) data into PostgreSQL and analyzed hourly trends.
The entity-relationship diagram for the resulting database structure is shown below along with a chart showing
topic page view changes across 2 hours.
