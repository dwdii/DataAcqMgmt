While looking around for a data set to use for this project,I bumped into a [Kaggle competition
to forecast bike sharing demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand). The data set 
looked decent, with 10,886 observations. There were no inherent character columns, the data 
was already converted to factor-like integer values. As such, in order to better map the data 
set to this exercise, I am reverting the `season` column to character data to begin with.
```{r}
# The path to the local dataset file
csv_file <- "C:/Users/Dan/Documents/My School/IS607-DataAcqMgmt/Week5/BikeSharingDemand.csv"

# Load the data into a data.frame
csv <- read.table(csv_file, header=TRUE, sep=",")

# Revert some columns to character data.
df_s <- data.frame(csv, seasonName=NA)
df_s[df_s$season == 1,]$seasonName = "spring"
df_s[df_s$season == 2,]$seasonName <- "summer"
df_s[df_s$season == 3,]$seasonName <- "fall"
df_s[df_s$season == 4,]$seasonName <- "winter"


# Dimensions
dim(df_s)

# Summary
summary(df_s)

head(df_s)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
