Which year were the best popular movies made? 1987? 2002? 1955? Using R and a [dataset provided by Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/data/movies/), have come to a conclusion. But first let me describe my process.

The dataset, originally from [IMDB.com](http://IMBD.com/), provides a variety of data points about each movie going back
as far as 1893 (but is current only through 2005). Some data points of interest IMDB user rating, the number of rating
votes cast, the budget for making the film, genre and MPAA rating.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
