### Data Set Use Case ###

The data set used in this comparative study was obtained from the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD). It contains fair market rent (FMR) data points for counties and 
metropolitan statisitcal areas through-out the United States of America. The FMR data points
are required to be published by as part of Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937.

FMR data is used by programs operating under Section 8 including the Housing Choice Voucher,
the Moderate Rehabilitation, and the project-based voucher programs. External to these programs,
this data set can be used to better understand differences in housing costs around the United States,
and if compared to other years, how costs are changing over time.

### Advantages / Disadvantages ###

#### R ####

The R runtime provides several functions for saving and loading data in the RData format. The `save` function will persist one or more variables to a specified file in either ASCII or binary format, and likewise the `load` function will deserialize the data from a given file into the R runtime's environment.

The RData format and associated functions are quite useful for importing and/or sharing small data sets, as well as preserving work from day to day. Mid-sized data sets (< 8GB) could be serialized using these functions as well, wherein the `compress` option might be a significant benefit. 

Beyond the use cases described above, the RData format is unlikely to be useful 
for larger data sets (8+ GB). The R runtime wants to place any data loaded from
RData files into the environment's memory space. Depending on your operating system
some of this may be swapped to disk, but nonetheless working memory is now limited
due to the presence of the loaded data.

Simultaneous access by multiple users could also be a problem. once a data set
is loaded from a given file, another user could also load the same data from the file,
for example if the file is shared on a network drive. Sharing changes presents a problem though.
The entire data set whould need to be serialized back to the file and notifications broadcast
to collegues of the need to reload the file.

In terms of security, if an unauthorized user where to acquire an RData file, there is no inherent
permissions management to prevent them from unauthorized access or updates to the data. 

For the Fair Market Rents data set, R's `read.table` function did not handle some of the 
encoding used in place names even when latin1 was specified for the encoding parameter.

#### PostgreSQL ####

[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/about/) is an open source relational database management
system (RDBMS) which stores data in databases and tables hosted through a separate data service typically on a separate server.

PostgreSQL is well suited for persisting data sets ranging from kilobytes through gigabytes to terabytes. According to the PostgreSQL website, a given database in not limited in size, and a given table within a database can be as large as 32TB. Since the data is hosted on a central server, sharing across multiple users is much simpler than the RData scenario. Each user can connect and query the data independently and PostgreSQL manages the access (security) as well as any updates that might be committed.

Once data is in a PostgreSQL database, sharing the data outside an organization is much more difficult.
It could be exported to a CSV file for example, though depending on the size of the data set, this might not be feasible. Alternatively, a web application interface might be developed to enable external access while maintaining security for other data sources.

For the Fair Market Rent data set, PostgreSQL pgAdmin's import utility loaded the data from the
CSV into a staging table very smoothly, including the handling of latin1 encoded characters, without issue. See the Appendix - PostreSQL Code for details regarding the database design and normalization
after the raw data was loaded. Although not strictly necessary, normalizing the data, such as state and county names, into look-up tables is considered best practice in RDBMS database design. Normalization requires several extra steps that might not be necessary for all data sets. In the case of the Fair Market Rent data, the normalization process revealed some missing data (a FIPS and county code) for Cumberland County, ME as shown in the following screenshot.

![Missing Data for Cumberland County](Project4-FairMarketRent-MissingData.png)


#### MongoDB ####

For the Faiir Market Rent data set, `mongoimport.exe` was used for data import. As mentioned previously, the data was in a Latin 1 encoding which MongoDB doesn't support. The utility did the best it could and imported all rows which didn't have Latin 1 specific encoding. The data set was
reimported after converting it to UTF-8 and `mongoimport` performed as expected and imported all rows without issue.


### Recommendation ###

### Appendix ###

#### Data Set Description ####
 
The specific data set used is the 2015 Fair Market Rent Country Level Data File:

http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/fmr/fmr2015f/FY2015F_4050_Final.xls

The data set was downloaded in Microsoft Excel format (XLS) and saved to CSV format to enable
easier access by the various technologies used throughout this study.

#### PostgreSQL Code ####

The following entity relationship diagram shows the database design created during the PostgreSQL portion of this comparative study. 

![Entity Relationship Diagram](Project4-FairMarketRents-ER.png)

Data was first imported into a staging table in PostgreSQL via the pgAdmin Import utility. After the
data was imported, SQL statements were used to split the data into the appropriate tables as shown in the code segment below.

``` sql
-- Normalize state info
INSERT INTO state (state_abbrev, code) 
  SELECT DISTINCT state_alpha, to_number(state, '99') 
  FROM staging ORDER BY state_alpha

-- Normalize area info
INSERT INTO area (area_name, stateid) 
  SELECT DISTINCT areaname, s.id
		FROM staging st
		LEFT JOIN state s ON s.state_abbrev = st.state_alpha
		ORDER BY areaname

-- Normalize county info
INSERT INTO county (county_name, code, areaid) 
	SELECT DISTINCT countyname, to_number(county, '999'), a.id 
		FROM staging st
		LEFT JOIN state s ON s.state_abbrev = st.state_alpha 
		LEFT JOIN area a ON a.area_name = st.areaname AND a.stateid = s.id
		ORDER BY countyname

-- Normalize county_town info
INSERT INTO county_town (county_town_name, countyid, pop2010) 
	SELECT DISTINCT county_town_name, c.id, to_number(pop2010, '999999999')
		FROM staging st
		LEFT JOIN state s ON s.state_abbrev = st.state_alpha
		LEFT JOIN area a ON a.area_name = st.areaname AND a.stateid = s.id
		LEFT JOIN county c ON c.county_name = st.countyname AND c.areaid = a.id
		ORDER BY county_town_name

INSERT INTO fmr (bedrooms, fmr, county_townid) 
	SELECT 0, to_number(fmr0, '999999'), ct.id
		FROM staging st
		LEFT JOIN state s ON s.state_abbrev = st.state_alpha
		LEFT JOIN area a ON a.area_name = st.areaname AND a.stateid = s.id
		LEFT JOIN county c ON c.county_name = st.countyname AND c.areaid = a.id
		LEFT JOIN county_town ct ON ct.county_town_name = st.county_town_name 
      AND ct.countyid = c.id

INSERT INTO fmr (bedrooms, fmr, county_townid) 
	SELECT 1, to_number(fmr1, '999999'), ct.id
		FROM staging st
		LEFT JOIN state s ON s.state_abbrev = st.state_alpha
		LEFT JOIN area a ON a.area_name = st.areaname AND a.stateid = s.id
		LEFT JOIN county c ON c.county_name = st.countyname AND c.areaid = a.id
		LEFT JOIN county_town ct ON ct.county_town_name = st.county_town_name 
      AND ct.countyid = c.id		

INSERT INTO fmr (bedrooms, fmr, county_townid) 
	SELECT 2, to_number(fmr2, '999999'), ct.id
		FROM staging st
		LEFT JOIN state s ON s.state_abbrev = st.state_alpha
		LEFT JOIN area a ON a.area_name = st.areaname AND a.stateid = s.id
		LEFT JOIN county c ON c.county_name = st.countyname AND c.areaid = a.id
		LEFT JOIN county_town ct ON ct.county_town_name = st.county_town_name 
      AND ct.countyid = c.id

INSERT INTO fmr (bedrooms, fmr, county_townid) 
	SELECT 3, to_number(fmr3, '999999'), ct.id
		FROM staging st
		LEFT JOIN state s ON s.state_abbrev = st.state_alpha
		LEFT JOIN area a ON a.area_name = st.areaname AND a.stateid = s.id
		LEFT JOIN county c ON c.county_name = st.countyname AND c.areaid = a.id
		LEFT JOIN county_town ct ON ct.county_town_name = st.county_town_name 
      AND ct.countyid = c.id

INSERT INTO fmr (bedrooms, fmr, county_townid) 
	SELECT 4, to_number(fmr4, '999999'), ct.id
		FROM staging st
		LEFT JOIN state s ON s.state_abbrev = st.state_alpha
		LEFT JOIN area a ON a.area_name = st.areaname AND a.stateid = s.id
		LEFT JOIN county c ON c.county_name = st.countyname AND c.areaid = a.id
		LEFT JOIN county_town ct ON ct.county_town_name = st.county_town_name 
      AND ct.countyid = c.id
```

Using a query such as the following, R can be used to query the PostgreSQL data and produce a similar
chart as in the R code shown previously.

```{r}
require("RPostgreSQL")

# PostgreSQL - connect
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
con <- dbConnect(drv,user="postgres",password="a",dbname="proj4")

# Query the Postgres data tables
sQuery <- "SELECT ct.pop2010 / 1000000.0 AS pop2010, 
                  fmr0.fmr AS fmr0, 
                  fmr2.fmr AS fmr2, 
                  fmr3.fmr AS fmr3 FROM  county_town ct 
  LEFT JOIN fmr fmr0 ON fmr0.county_townid = ct.id AND fmr0.bedrooms = 0
  LEFT JOIN fmr fmr2 ON fmr2.county_townid = ct.id AND fmr2.bedrooms = 2
  LEFT JOIN fmr fmr3 ON fmr3.county_townid = ct.id AND fmr3.bedrooms = 3" 
res <- dbGetQuery(con, sQuery)

g6 <- ggplot(data=res, aes(x=pop2010))
g6 <- g6 + geom_point(aes(y=fmr0, colour="Studio"))
g6 <- g6 + geom_point(aes(y=fmr2, colour="2 Bedroom"))
g6 <- g6 + geom_point(aes(y=fmr3, colour="3 Bedroom"))
g6 <- g6 + scale_fill_hue(l=40)
g6 <- g6 + ylim(0, 3000)
g6 <- g6 + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=30, vjust=1))
g6 <- g6 + guides(colour = guide_legend("Legend"))
g6 <- g6 + labs(title="Fair Market Rent vs. 2010 Census (via PostgreSQL)",
                x="2010 Census Population (Millions)",
                y="Fair Market Rent (USD)")
g6

```
